  <h1>Hello, my name is Anton Ratnikov</h1>

  <p>
    I am a software engineer. My specialization is a front end and team leadership.Â <a href="/projects/">Projects</a>

  <p>
    I like to work with people. It helps me and them become better engineers.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have been staying hungry for technologies and best practices since I started my career {{ expYears }} years ago.
    In my day-to-day work I mostly use Typescript.
    I like to use no-code solutions to perform routine tasks, which makes my life easier.
    I am a fast learner, able to pick up new skills, projects, and roles.

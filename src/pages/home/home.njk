    For my day to day work, I mostly use Typescript.
    I started my way {{ expYears }} years ago, since that time I always stay hungry for technologies and best practices.
    Like to use no-code solutions for day to day routine and it makes my life easier.
    Iâ€™m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills, projects, and roles.
